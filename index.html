            <h3>Blog Stuff</h3>
            <p>This is where I blog and do cool blog stuff. I might talk about doing technical things or maybe my thoughts on pixel density. I am a huge fan of high pixel density. Maybe I'll look into html and how it works with different aspect ratios and densities. This has surely filled up enough space now. My best estimate is that is is 6 lines on a standard 1920x1080 and maybe 2.5 on an ultrawide. Let's check it out.</p>
            <p>***Update***</p>
            <p>I wasn't even close.</p>

            <p>This is where I talk about all of the things I have in development or things I have made maybe.</p>
            <p>Right now I am absolutely developing some html and css.</p>
            <p>This is html part 2; h2ml.</p>
            <p>Not to be confused with html 2</p>

            <h3>Hometown</h3>
            <p>Baldwin, Michigan is a tiny town that, no matter who you are talking to, they either:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Their family has a cabin/property there</li>
                <li>They camped there 2 summers ago or as an adolescent</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There is no real industry withing 30 miles of Baldwin besides tourism. People come to camp, fish, hunt, and go to Jones' Ice Cream. Jones' never really stuck on me. I never hear it mentioned within groups of people that live there. It is a place that primarily exists for tourists.</p>
            <p>Another big tourism draw for Baldwin is snowmobiling. Many of same people that occupy Baldwin also don't believe in climate change, but their snowmobiling seasons have been short and unfulfilling in the last 20 years, but that's for another class. </p>
            <p>Ted Nugent is a DARE officer in Lake County and has a cabin in Baldwin on Nugent Lake(no affiliation). George W. Bush also had a cabin on Nugent Lake, but I'm not sure if that is still the case. It's a weird place.</p>
            <p>Just on the outskirts of Baldwin is Idlewild. I believe they share a zip code nowadays. Aretha Franklin had a cabin there until the day she passed. Idlewild used to be one of the major motown hotspots. It was known as a Black Wallstreet with over 300 businesses in the late 50s and early 60s. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964, people left the area to rightfully pursue things in other states and big cities. Idlewild only has ~5 businesses today. You don't learn any of this history while you live in the town for most of your life though, just when you're older and learning it on the internet. </p>

            <p>There was also a town that is now absorbed within Baldwin called Marlborough. It used to be the largest cement manufacturer is the world. This was like...in the late 1800s/very early 1900s though, so who knows how well that was actually recorded. Also who was keeping tabs on that? Do they know how big Russia and China are? Anyway, I grew up within walking distance of some of the cement factory ruins and it truly does not impress me. I just read the wiki and apparently there are only ruins now because they dynamited the place for scrap iron in 1906. If you grew up in Baldwin (you didn't or I would know you), you would know that blowing things up and scrap metal are very Baldwinian things that people do, so the 1906 thing tracks.</p>
            <p>About 12 miles to the northeast is Luther has a massive Michigan Militia compound surrounded by a 10 foot dirt berm and a giant razorwire fence surrounding the several hundred acre property. I met lots of strange people out of there as a child and looking back I am glad I wasn't indoctrinated by any of them. Wait is this a computer class? Shit.</p>
